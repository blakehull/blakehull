Hi! I'm Blake, a Senior Software Engineer.
I've been an engineer for 23andMe and Overstock, working on projects ranging from machine learning (llms, LTR, classification, feature engineering, NLP, and logistic regression) to high performance cloud computing.

In Machine Learning, I enjoy NLP and Classification problems, and generally I like working in cloud infrastructures and connecting disparate data sources together. I also enjoy cryptography, number theory and mathematical modeling of biological and psychological phenomena.
